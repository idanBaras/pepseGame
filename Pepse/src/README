the main class in this hierchy is flora, all the other 3 classes are being used in it,

also after getting the objects back from tree is in random adding fruits to some leaves.
leaves class is being use by the tree class mostly which create them, 
they are only being used in one more place which is in flora to create fruits in some leaves.
tree class is only being used by flora class to spawn trees.
